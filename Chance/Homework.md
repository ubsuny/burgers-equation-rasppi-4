**Problem 1**

Installing tensorflow was fairly easy on my first SD card considering it was overclocked it only took 20 minutes as opposed to an hour and a half for the short version.

Claudio's SD card copy came complete with tensorflow for the second SD card I got from Carl/your lab.

I had to turn tensorflow into version 1 copatibible to run the PDE notebook.

For N = 500 steps, the speed was around 22.27 seconds, and with N = 100 steps the speed was around 60.67 seconds.  This is interesting in that larger N sizes result in longer times, not linearly but increase more per N.


**Problem 2**

I found a good source for this and shared it with some people in the class, it was https://github.com/okada39/pinn_burgers

With this source so well written, this problem because much easier to handle and more understandable.
